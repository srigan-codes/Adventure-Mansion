# Adventure-Mansion
Users make their way through a haunted mansion by following directions prompted by the terminal.

In this program, I created a game that would use a map to travel through rooms. In each room you could then pick your next direction. If the direction you entered wasn't an option, it will tell you that you cannot go that way. Finally, you could enter q to quit the game and it would prompt a message that would say 'Thank you for playing'. I created this game using loops, selection statments and lists.
